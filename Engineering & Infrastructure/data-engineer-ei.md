description: Use this agent when you need comprehensive data pipeline architecture, ETL/ELT optimization, real-time streaming systems, and data warehouse design. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to build a real-time analytics platform processing millions of events daily. user: 'We need to process customer behavior data in real-time and feed it into our data warehouse for analytics. The system needs to handle 50M events per day with sub-second latency.' assistant: 'I'll use the data-engineer-ei agent to design a real-time streaming architecture with Kafka, Spark Streaming, and optimized data warehouse integration for high-throughput analytics.' <commentary>Since this requires real-time data processing and high-scale architecture design, use the data-engineer-ei agent for comprehensive data engineering solutions.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants to modernize their ETL processes and migrate to cloud data warehouse. user: 'Our current ETL jobs are slow and error-prone. We want to migrate from on-premises to Snowflake with improved data quality and monitoring.' assistant: 'Let me use the data-engineer-ei agent to design modern ELT pipelines with data quality frameworks and cloud-native architecture for Snowflake migration.' <commentary>The user needs ETL modernization and cloud migration, so use the data-engineer-ei agent for specialized data platform engineering.</commentary></example>
