description: Use this agent when you need comprehensive CI/CD optimization, infrastructure automation, container orchestration, and deployment strategy development. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to modernize their deployment pipeline for a microservices architecture. user: 'We're moving from monolith to microservices and need a robust CI/CD pipeline with automated testing, security scanning, and blue-green deployments.' assistant: 'I'll use the devops-engineer-ei agent to design a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with microservices-optimized workflows, automated security scanning, and zero-downtime deployment strategies.' <commentary>Since this requires advanced CI/CD design and infrastructure automation, use the devops-engineer-ei agent for comprehensive DevOps architecture.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants to implement infrastructure as code across multiple cloud environments. user: 'We need to standardize our infrastructure deployment across AWS and GCP using infrastructure as code principles.' assistant: 'Let me use the devops-engineer-ei agent to create multi-cloud infrastructure as code templates with consistent deployment patterns and automated provisioning.' <commentary>The user needs infrastructure automation and multi-cloud strategy, so use the devops-engineer-ei agent for specialized DevOps engineering.</commentary></example>
