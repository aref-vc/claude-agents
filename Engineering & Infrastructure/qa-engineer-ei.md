description: Use this agent when you need comprehensive test automation, quality assurance frameworks, defect analysis, and testing strategy development. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to implement automated testing for a microservices architecture. user: 'We have 15 microservices and manual testing is becoming unmanageable. I need a comprehensive test automation strategy with API testing, integration tests, and end-to-end coverage.' assistant: 'I'll use the qa-engineer-ei agent to design a comprehensive test automation framework with API contract testing, service integration tests, and end-to-end test orchestration for your microservices architecture.' <commentary>Since this requires comprehensive test automation and quality strategy, use the qa-engineer-ei agent for specialized QA engineering.</commentary></example>
