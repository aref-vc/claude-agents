## ü§ñ What are Claude Code Agents?

Claude Code agents are specialized AI assistants that can be invoked using the `Task` tool within Claude Code. Each agent is designed with specific expertise, tools, and workflows to handle particular types of tasks more effectively than a general-purpose assistant. All agents feature professional YAML frontmatter, senior-level personas with 6-12+ years of experience, and comprehensive methodologies.
